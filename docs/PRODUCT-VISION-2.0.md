- **Primary Value Prop:** Time-Saving (20h/month gespart)
- **Target Pain:** Manuelle Excel-Arbeit nervt

## 📊 WHY THE PIVOT?

### **Key Insights aus Meetings:**

1. **Loan Rejection Crisis:**
   - 60% of Kenyan SME loan applications rejected
   - #1 Reason: "Insufficient financial records"
   - WEF + SACCOs actively looking for solutions

2. **Market Size:**
   - 7.4M SMEs in Kenya
   - 79% informal (Jua Kali, Mama Mboga, Dukas)
   - Most have M-Pesa transactions BUT no organized records

3. **Competitive Advantage:**
   - NO existing solution bridges M-Pesa → Loan-ready records
   - Pay Hero = payroll (not M-Pesa statements)
   - Banks don't accept handwritten books

4. **Partnership Opportunities:**
   - Women Enterprise Fund (WEF) interest confirmed
   - SACCOs need standardized records for loan processing
   - M-Pesa Agents network potential distribution

```

## 🚀 PRODUCT ROADMAP 2.0

### **Phase 0: Waitlist (NOW - March 2026)**
**Goal:** Validate loan-access value proposition
**Deliverable:** Redesigned waitlist page (financial inclusion focus)
**Metrics:**
- 500+ signups by Feb 2026
- 40%+ check "loan partnerships" checkbox
- Conversion rate >5% (mobile)

**Key Changes:**

- Pricing: Show cost (KES 499/mo) for transparency
- FAQ: Address loan-help objections first

**GTM Strategy (UPDATED 12.11.2025):**

  - Grace interviews (10 SMEs)
  - Target: 30+ signups Week 1
  
Priority 3: WEF Outreach (LONG-TERM) ⚠️
  - Bank account requirement = barrier
  - Digital platform (*254#) accepts M-Pesa BUT limited
  - Manual process rejects M-Pesa statements
  - Strategy: Position as bank account workaround tool
  - Timeline: Q2 2026 (after SACCO traction)
```
